As of June 2020, this is still a work in progress. Relies on `R` (v. 3.6.1), `geomorph` (v. 3.1.3), and `landvR` (v. 0.4).

## Data
**Landmarking data:**
* [MorphoSource Project 561](https://www.morphosource.org/Detail/ProjectDetail/Show/project_id/561) publically provides 3D meshes for all surface scanned crania landmarked in the study.
* [Raw_Coordinates.csv](Data/Raw/Raw_Coord_Data.csv) provides the shape coordinates from landmarked 3D skulls, exported from Viewbox.

**Museum metadata provided by Curators:**
* [Australian Museum specimens](/Data/Raw/AM_muridae_skulls.csv)
* [Melbourne Museum specimens](/Data/Raw/MV_muridae_skulls.csv)
* [Queensland Museum specimens](/Data/Raw/QM_muridae_skulls.csv)
* [South Australian Museum specimens](/Data/Raw/SAM_muridae_skulls.csv)

**Ecological metadata:**
* [Trait data from Breed & Ford 2007](/Data/Processed/in_ex_traits.csv)

## Analyses
**The first three scripts prepare the data for analysis and plotting**, the intermediate data generated by script 03 and 04 are stored in .rda files and used in later scripts.

* [01-extract-data-for-analyses.Rmd](/Analysis/01-extract-data-for-analyses.Rmd) Extracts both 3D coordinate data and metadata from Viewbox. Prepares them for analysis in `geomorph` by running GPA with bilateral symmetry and then merging the symmetric shape component with centroid size for each specimen.
* [02-calculate-user-error.Rmd](/Analysis/02-calculate-user-error.Rmd) Allows users to view outliers and find major landmarking errors. Calculates user error based on repeatability.
* [03-prepare-data.Rmd](/Analysis/03-prepare-data.Rmd) Creates the metadata and graphing vectors needed for all subsequent analyses. Prepares mean shape data and the ultrametric phylogenetic tree for analyses that require a phylogeny. 

**The next three scripts produce the main results:**

* [04-measure-allometry.Rmd](/Analysis/04-measure-allometry.Rmd) Tests static and evolutionary allometry with `geomorph`'s `procD.lm`'s ANCOVA function. `RRPP`'s `pairwise` function. This includes Procrustes ANOVAs and pairwise homogeneity of slopes (HOS) tests. Tests whether the HOS result is distinct from null (global slope) expectancy with a randomization procedure. **Generates Table 1 and Table A4**.
* [05-phylogenetic-rarefaction.Rmd](/Analysis/05-phylogenetic-rarefaction.Rmd) Uses phylogenetic rarefaction to tests for impact of species-level sample sizes on allometric findings with rarifaction across every clade in the phylogeny using `landvR`. **Generates Figure 3 and Figure A2**.
* [06-measure-evo-rates.Rmd](/Analysis/06-measure-evo-rates.Rmd) Runs `geomorph`'s `compare.evol.rates()` function on species with locomotion and dietary specializations to see if they evolved more slowly or more quickly than sister taxa. **Generates Table A6**.

**The next two scripts produce the main multi-panel figures:** 

* [07-plot-heatmaps.Rmd](/Analysis/07-plot-heatmaps.Rmd) Plots landmark heatmaps showing statistically rigorous visualizations of allometric shape variation from the mean (consensus) shape to either the PC1 mininum or to PC1 maximum (dorsal and lateral views). **Generates the four images for Figure 4C-F**.
* [08-plot-allometry.Rmd](/Analysis/08-plot-allometry.Rmd) Plots static allometry with both Regression Scores and Predicted Values. Plots evolutionary allometry of mean shape data, a PCA of the mean shape data, combined with four heatmap views of the crania shape changes across PC1. **Generates Figure 1, Figure 2, and Figure 4**.

### Custom functions 
* Some analyses call custom functions, which are defined in the [..Data/Functions/utilities.R](/Data/Functions/utilities.R) file.

* **Sup01-combine-metadata-sex-info.Rmd** This supplementary script reattaches sex information and museum of origin to the specimen metadata using the four museums' original metadata. **Generates Table A1**
